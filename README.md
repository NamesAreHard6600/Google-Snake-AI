# Google-Snake-AI
This project was insanely fun. Simply put, this is an AI that plays google snake for me. It doesn't have neural networks or anything, but people typically understand what I mean when I say AI. If you want to, you can even run it yourself! 

## Steps:
1. Download the code and python 
2. Make sure you have installed "pyautogui" "PIL" and "pynput". 
3. You probaly will have to change some of the constants at the top of the code, but they are all commented and not too complicated to figure out. 
4. You should be able to figure it out from there. 

## Notes:
This snake AI was not designed in any shape or form to live for a long period of time. The biggest it's gotten is 54, which is okay, but it doesn't get that with any kind of consistency. Instead, it was desinged with the intent of speedrunning the 25 apple category on: https://www.speedrun.com/snake_game/level/Classic_Mode_Standard#25_Apples

Its best time was a 25:245, at the time of writing this, 2.5 seconds faster than world record, and probably world record for humans for the rest of time. Which is a success in my eyes. If I wanted to make it more consistent, I'd have to implement A* probably, and I just didn't have the need to do that. But overall, for the 6 or so hours I put into this on one weekend, I'm extremely excited to be able to show this off, and it's something I can show others and they can make sense of it.
